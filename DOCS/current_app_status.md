# Current Application Status

## Overview

The current application is a Design Brief tool built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to fill out a comprehensive design brief for construction or renovation projects. The application collects information across multiple sections including project details, budget, lifestyle preferences, site information, space requirements, and more. It also supports file uploads, PDF generation, and has a UI built with ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS.

## Application Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **React 18** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **React Router** for navigation (routes defined in `App.tsx` for `/`, `/about`, and `*`)

### State Management
- Uses React Context API via `DesignBriefContext` for global state management of the design brief.
- State is organized into sections corresponding to the design brief sections.
- Custom hooks (`useRoomsManagement`, `useProfessionalsManagement`, `useFileAndSummaryManagement`) encapsulate specific state logic within the context.

### UI Components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ShadCN UI** component library
- Custom components for specific UI needs

### Data Management
- Form data primarily stored in `DesignBriefContext`.
- File uploads likely handled in context state before persistence.
- PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` via utility functions.

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase** (`@supabase/supabase-js`) for authentication and intended data storage.
- Supabase client initialized in `lib/supabase/schema.ts` using environment variables.
- `useSupabase.tsx` hook provides core authentication functions (signIn, signUp, signOut) and manages session/user state.
- `lib/supabase/services/projectService.ts` contains comprehensive functions (`saveProject`, `loadProject`) for creating, updating, and retrieving detailed project data from Supabase, interacting with multiple tables (projects, project_settings, rooms, etc.). It uses local storage for `current_project_id`.
- `database.types.ts` provides TypeScript types generated from the Supabase schema.
- `migrations.sql` contains SQL for database schema.

## Current Features

1. **Multi-section Design Brief Form**:
   - Project Information
   - Budget Information
   - Lifestyle & Occupants
   - Site Information
   - Spaces & Rooms
   - Architecture & Materials
   - Contractors & Professionals
   - Communication Preferences
   - Uploads
   - Summary
   - Feedback

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Room management (add, edit, remove)
   - Professional management (add, edit, remove)
   - File uploads
   - Map location selection (using Leaflet)

3. **PDF Generation**:
   - Complete PDF generation of the design brief using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`.
   - Includes a `sendByEmail` (mailto) utility for the PDF.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - `DesignBriefContext` now uses Supabase for data persistence through the `projectService.ts` module.
   - Authentication is required to save project data, as all data is stored in user-specific Supabase tables.
   - File uploads are processed and stored in Supabase Storage, with metadata tracked in the database.
   - Auto-save functionality is implemented with debounce to avoid excessive API calls.

## Missing/Incomplete Features

1. **Authentication System**:
   - `useSupabase.tsx` authentication hook is present and functional.
   - No login/register UI components exist yet (e.g., `src/components/auth/` is empty).
   - The `signOut` function in `useSupabase.tsx` navigates to `/login`, but this route is not currently defined in `App.tsx`.

2. **Dashboard**:
   - No client dashboard implementation
   - Empty dashboard directory structure

3. **Multi-user Support**:
   - No admin/client distinction in the current UI
   - No project management beyond a single brief

4. **Backend Integration**:
   - While `projectService.ts` is well-developed for Supabase interaction, its integration into the main UI flow (currently managed by `DesignBriefContext` with local storage) is likely incomplete or not yet implemented. The primary data saving mechanism visible in the context is local storage.
   - Full utilization of Supabase for all design brief data persistence from the UI is pending.

## Technical Debt and Observations

1. **Duplicated Components**:
   - `DesignBriefSidebar.tsx` and `DesignBriefSidebar.refactored.tsx` exist.

2. **Incomplete Authentication Integration**:
   - Authentication hooks (`useSupabase.tsx`) exist and are now properly integrated with the application flow.
   - Login/registration pages and protected routes have been implemented.

3. **Empty Directories**:
   - Several directories are created but empty (dashboard, services)

4. **Local vs. Remote Storage Strategy**:
   - The application now uses a Supabase-only approach for data persistence.
   - No localStorage dependencies remain in the main data flow.
   - All project data is now tied to authenticated users.
   
5. **Partial Supabase UI Integration**:
   - Supabase is now fully integrated as the main data backend for the design brief.
   - `DesignBriefContext` has been refactored to be authentication-aware, with proper loading states and error handling.
   - File uploads are now handled directly through Supabase Storage with database references.

## Next Steps for Implementing Dashboard

Based on the current codebase and the implementation plan, the next steps would be:

1. ~~Complete the authentication system using existing Supabase hooks~~ ✓
2. ~~Create client registration and admin login pages~~ ✓
3. Implement dashboard UI based on the three-stage workflow
4. Connect the existing design brief to the project/client data structure
5. ~~Implement server-side persistence of all design brief data~~ ✓
6. Add status tracking functionality
7. Create notification systems for status changes

The core design brief functionality is already well-developed, and now with Supabase integration complete, this is a solid foundation for adding the client dashboard and admin functionality.
