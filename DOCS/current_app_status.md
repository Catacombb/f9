# Current Application Status

## Overview

The current application is a Design Brief tool built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to fill out a comprehensive design brief for construction or renovation projects. The application collects information across multiple sections including project details, budget, lifestyle preferences, site information, space requirements, and more.
**Observation**: The application, in its current state as observed from the codebase and `package.json`, appears to be primarily a frontend application. The extensive Supabase backend integration, authentication, PDF generation, and dashboard features described in previous versions of this document are not currently evident in the live file structure or dependencies.

## File Structure and Organization

**Note on Obsolete Directories**: Automated attempts to delete `src/emailTemplates/` and `src/utils/pdfGenerator/` failed due to an issue with file resolution. These directories are non-functional in the current application state (missing dependencies, tied to unimplemented backend features) and are recommended for manual deletion.

```
**Missing from previous doc (not found at `src/components/`):** `auth/`, `dashboard/`, `MapLocation.tsx`.

#### `src/context/` Management
**Observation**: Structure matches previous doc. However, described Supabase integration is unlikely given missing Supabase services.
```
context/
├── DesignBriefContext.tsx       # Main context provider (Supabase integration TBC - projectService.ts missing)
├── designBriefUtils.ts          # Utility functions for context
├── initialState.ts              # Initial state data
├── types.ts                     # Context type definitions
├── useFileAndSummaryManagement.ts # File and summary hooks (Supabase integration TBC)
├── useProfessionalsManagement.ts  # Professional management hooks
└── useRoomsManagement.ts        # Room management hooks
```

#### `src/lib/` (Previously `lib/supabase/`)
**Observation**: The extensive `lib/supabase/` structure (client, services, SQL) was not found.
```
lib/
├── animation.ts
└── utils.ts                     # Generic utility functions (cn)
```
**Missing from previous doc (not found):** `lib/supabase/` directory including `core_tables.sql`, `dashboard_schema.sql`, `migrations.sql`, `fix_*.sql`, `database.types.ts`, `schema.ts` (Supabase client init), and `services/` subdirectory (`projectService.ts`, `statusService.ts`, etc.).

#### `src/utils/`
**Observation**: `pdfGenerator/` might be present but its functionality is questionable without PDF libraries in `package.json`.
```
utils/
├── pdfGenerator/                # PDF generation utilities (functionality TBC - jsPDF/html2canvas missing from dependencies - RECOMMENDED FOR DELETION, automated attempt failed)
│   ├── helpers.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── layout.ts
│   ├── types.ts
│   └── sections/
└── testDataGenerator.ts         # Test data generation
```

#### `src/hooks/`
**Observation**: `useSupabase.tsx` hook is missing.
```
hooks/
├── use-mobile.tsx               # Mobile detection hook
└── use-toast.ts                 # Toast notification hook
```
**Missing from previous doc (not found):** `useSupabase.tsx`.

#### `src/pages/`
**Observation**: Test pages related to Supabase/Dashboard are missing.
```
pages/                           # Top-level page components
├── Index.tsx                    # Main landing page / entry point for the Design Brief
├── About.tsx                    # About page
└── NotFound.tsx                 # Catch-all 404 page
```
**Missing from previous doc (not found):** `TestSupabasePage.tsx`, `TestDashboardSchemePage.tsx`.


## Application Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **React 18** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **React Router** for navigation (`App.tsx` shows basic routing to DesignBriefPage, no protected routes observed).
- **TanStack Query** (Not found in `package.json` - needs verification if used, or remove mention)

### State Management
- Uses React Context API via `DesignBriefContext` for global state management of the design brief.
- State is organized into sections corresponding to the design brief sections.
- Custom hooks (`useRoomsManagement`, `useProfessionalsManagement`, `useFileAndSummaryManagement`) encapsulate specific state logic within the context.
- **Observation**: Context integration with Supabase via `projectService.ts` is not currently possible as `projectService.ts` and Supabase client setup are missing. How state is persisted beyond session is unclear.

### UI Components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ShadCN UI** component library (dialog, button, card, etc.) - Dependencies present.
- Custom components for specific UI needs (Sidebar, Sections, etc.).
- Theme hardcoded to 'light' via `ThemeProvider.tsx`. The `next-themes` dependency is not present in `package.json`.

### Data Management
- Form data likely stored in `DesignBriefContext`.
- **Observation**: Persistence to Supabase as described (via `projectService.ts`) is not implemented due to missing Supabase setup and services.
- **Observation**: File uploads handling by Supabase Storage (via `uploadProjectFile` function) is unconfirmed and unlikely without Supabase client/SDK.
- **Observation**: PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` is unlikely as these libraries are not found in `package.json`.
- **Observation**: Dashboard data aggregation (`dashboardService.ts`) is not implemented.

### Backend Integration
- **Observation**: The described Supabase (`@supabase/supabase-js`) integration for authentication and data storage is not evident. `@supabase/supabase-js` is missing from `package.json`.
- **Observation**: Supabase client initialization (`lib/supabase/schema.ts`) is missing.
- **Observation**: `useSupabase.tsx` hook (for auth functions) is missing.
- **Observation**: `projectService.ts` and other dashboard services (`statusService`, `roleService`, `activitiesService`, `dashboardService`) are missing.
- **Observation**: Database schema files, triggers, and RLS policies mentioned are not found within the `src/lib/supabase/` path. Their existence elsewhere is unconfirmed.

## Current Features
**Overall Observation**: Many previously listed features dependent on backend integration (Supabase), authentication, and dashboard functionality do not appear to be implemented in the current codebase.

1. **Multi-section Design Brief Form**:
   - Project Information
   - Budget Information
   - Lifestyle & Occupants
   - Site Information
   - Spaces & Rooms
   - Architecture & Materials
   - Contractors & Professionals
   - Communication Preferences
   - Uploads (UI elements might exist, backend storage TBC)
   - Summary
   - Feedback
   **(This core form functionality appears to be the primary focus of the current application)**

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Room management (add, edit, remove) - Likely client-side via Context.
   - Professional management (add, edit, remove) - Likely client-side via Context.
   - File uploads (UI elements may exist, actual upload to a backend TBC).
   - Map location selection (Component `MapLocation.tsx` not found at `src/components/`).
   - Predictive address finding (Component `PredictiveAddressFinder.tsx` exists).

3. **PDF Generation**:
   - **Observation**: Unlikely to be functional. `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` are not in `package.json`. The `sendByEmail` utility would also be affected.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - **Observation**: Supabase integration for data persistence is not implemented (missing Supabase client, services, and SDK in `package.json`). Data might be persisted in browser's local storage or be session-based if `DesignBriefContext` handles this, but not to a Supabase backend as described.
   - Auto-save functionality with debounce (If implemented, would be client-side).

5. **Authentication System**:
   - **Observation**: Not implemented. No auth components (`Login`, `Register`, `ProtectedRoute`), no auth routes in `App.tsx`, no `useSupabase.tsx` hook, and no Supabase SDK.

6. **Dashboard Backend Functionality**:
   - **Observation**: Not implemented. Missing Supabase services (`statusService`, `roleService`, `activitiesService`, `dashboardService`) and database schema extensions in the expected locations.

7. **Dashboard UI**:
   - **Observation**: Not implemented. Missing dashboard components (`DashboardLayout`, `AdminDashboard`, etc.) and related routes.

## Missing/Incomplete Features (Based on current codebase vs. previous doc)

1.  **Full Backend Integration (Supabase)**:
    *   Supabase client setup and SDK.
    *   Database interaction services (`projectService`, etc.).
    *   Data persistence to a backend database.
2.  **User Authentication System**:
    *   Login, registration, password recovery flows.
    *   Protected routes.
    *   Session management with a backend.
3.  **Dashboard (Backend & UI)**:
    *   All backend services for dashboard.
    *   All UI components for admin and client dashboards.
    *   Project management, status tracking, activity feeds from a backend.
4.  **PDF Generation and Export**:
    *   Functionality to generate and download/email PDFs.
5.  **File Upload Persistence**:
    *   Saving uploaded files to a backend (e.g., Supabase Storage).
6.  **Client Portal UI & Functionality**.
7.  **Notifications System**.
8.  **MapLocation.tsx component functionality.**

## Technical Debt and Observations (Revised based on current codebase)

1.  ~~**Critical Bug in `projectService.loadProject`**~~: `projectService.ts` is missing. The general issue of loading/saving project data to/from a persistent store is now a missing feature rather than a bug in a specific service.
2.  **Project Creation Flow**: The document mentioned manual project creation from a dashboard. Since the dashboard is missing, this flow is not applicable. Project creation likely happens in-memory or via local context.
3.  ~~**Redundant Activity Logging**~~: `statusService.ts` is missing.
4.  **Toaster Libraries**: Previous doc mentioned `Sonner`. `App.tsx` only imports Shadcn's `Toaster`. `package.json` does not list `sonner`. This point seems resolved or was based on outdated info.
5.  **Hardcoded Light Theme**: `ThemeProvider.tsx` forces a light theme. `next-themes` dependency is not present in `package.json`.
6.  **Potentially Unused CSS/Code**: `App.css` contains boilerplate Vite styles that might be unused or conflict. `src/lib/animation.ts` duplicates the `cn` utility function from `src/lib/utils.ts` (Note: `src/lib/utils.ts` was observed, `animation.ts` needs content check for `cn` duplication).
7.  ~~**Service Join Syntax**~~: Supabase services are missing.
8.  **Test Coverage**: Needs re-evaluation based on the current limited feature set.
9.  **Missing TanStack Query**: Document mentioned TanStack Query, but it's not in `package.json`. If not used, remove mention.

## Next Steps for Implementation (Revised based on current codebase)

Given the current state, "next steps" would involve re-implementing or newly implementing most of the backend-dependent features if the goal is to match the application previously described.

1.  **Establish Backend Strategy**:
    *   Decide if Supabase (or another backend) will be used.
    *   If Supabase: Add SDK, set up client, define schema, implement services.
2.  **Implement Core Backend Services**:
    *   Project data persistence (`projectService.ts` or equivalent).
    *   File storage integration.
3.  **Implement Authentication**:
    *   Add auth UI components (Login, Register).
    *   Integrate with backend auth provider.
    *   Implement protected routes.
4.  **Implement Dashboard (Backend & UI)**:
    *   Develop backend services for dashboard data.
    *   Build UI components for dashboard views.
5.  **Implement PDF Generation**:
    *   Add necessary libraries (e.g., `jsPDF`, `html2canvas`).
    *   Develop PDF generation logic.
6.  **Address Technical Debt**:
    *   Decide on theme strategy.
    *   Clean up any unused CSS/code (e.g. check `cn` duplication if confirmed).
    *   Verify if TanStack Query is used, add if needed or remove mention.
7.  **Implement Client Portal UI & Notifications** (once backend and auth are in place).
8.  **Review and Restore/Reimplement features** like `MapLocation.tsx` if still required.

This document reflects the application's state based on a review of its file structure and `package.json` on [Date of Review]. It appears significantly different from a previous, more feature-rich description.
