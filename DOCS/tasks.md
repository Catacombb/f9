# Dashboard Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing the client onboarding dashboard functionality as described in the implementation document.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Extensions (1-2 weeks)

### Database Schema Updates
- [x] Add status column to projects table with values (brief, sent, complete)
- [x] Create user_profiles table with role field (admin, client)
- [x] Create activities table for logging actions and status changes
- [x] Add timestamps for status transitions in projects table or activities
- [x] Update database.types.ts with new schema types

### Security Policies
- [x] Configure RLS policies for user_profiles table
- [x] Configure RLS policies for activities table
- [x] Update existing RLS policies if needed for new schema

### Database Triggers
- [x] Create trigger function for new user registration
- [x] Implement automatic role assignment (client by default)
- [x] Add trigger for automatic project creation on client registration
- [x] Create trigger for logging status changes in activities table

### Testing
- [ ] Test database operations with the new schema
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are working correctly
- [ ] Test triggers with various scenarios
- [ ] Validate type generation and TypeScript integration

## Phase 2: Core Dashboard Logic (2-3 weeks)

### Services Creation
- [ ] Create statusService.ts for managing project statuses
- [ ] Implement roleService.ts for role-based access control

### Activity Logging
- [ ] Create standardized activity logging function
- [ ] Implement activity retrieval with filtering
- [ ] Add activity grouping by project and type
- [ ] Build activity timeline generation

### Testing
- [ ] Test status transition logic with various scenarios
- [ ] Verify role-based permissions
- [ ] Validate activity logging and retrieval
- [ ] Test services with mocked components

## Phase 3: Dashboard UI Development (2-3 weeks)

### Layout Components
- [ ] Create DashboardLayout component 
- [ ] Build AdminDashboard and ClientDashboard containers
- [ ] Implement navigation and sidebar for dashboard
- [ ] Create dashboard header with user information and actions

### Project Management UI
- [ ] Build ProjectList component with status visualization
- [ ] Create ProjectCard with status indicators
- [ ] Implement status filtering and sorting controls
- [ ] Add quick action buttons for status changes

### Statistics and Visualization
- [ ] Create StatusSummary component (counts by status)
- [ ] Implement simple data visualizations (charts/graphs)
- [ ] Build activity feed component
- [ ] Add recent clients section

### Detail Views
- [ ] Create ProjectDetail view with comprehensive information
- [ ] Build ClientDetail view with projects and activity
- [ ] Implement project timeline component
- [ ] Add document management UI for brief files

### Testing
- [ ] Test UI rendering with various data scenarios
- [ ] Verify responsive design across device sizes
- [ ] Validate user interactions and state updates
- [ ] Test accessibility of dashboard components

## Phase 4: Client Portal & Notifications (1-2 weeks)

### Client Portal
- [ ] Create ClientPortal component
- [ ] Build status tracking interface for clients
- [ ] Implement document download functionality
- [ ] Add feedback/approval mechanisms

### Real-time Updates
- [ ] Configure Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- [ ] Implement real-time status updates
- [ ] Add real-time notifications for status changes
- [ ] Create activity stream with live updates

### Notification System
- [ ] Build notification generation for status changes
- [ ] Implement in-app notification components
- [ ] Create email notification templates
- [ ] Add notification preferences UI

### Testing
- [ ] Test real-time functionality with multiple users
- [ ] Verify notification delivery across channels
- [ ] Validate client portal functionality
- [ ] Test end-to-end user journeys

## Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (1 week)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes
- [ ] Implement data caching strategies
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders in UI
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens

### UX Improvements
- [ ] Refine animations and transitions
- [ ] Improve error handling and messages
- [ ] Add empty states and guided flows
- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness

### Security Review
- [ ] Conduct final RLS policy review
- [ ] Verify authentication protection
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Validate data sanitization

### Finalization
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for admin dashboard
- [ ] Prepare deployment checklist
- [ ] Conduct final integration testing

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, start with Phase 1 by adding the required columns and tables to the database schema. The first step is to modify the core_tables.sql file to include:

1. Add status column to projects table ✓
2. Create user_profiles table with role field ✓
3. Create activities table for logging ✓

After applying these schema changes, update the TypeScript types and begin implementing the necessary security policies and triggers.
