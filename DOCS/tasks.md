## Getting Started

To begin implementation, start with Phase 1 by adding the required columns and tables to the database schema. The first step is to modify the core_tables.sql file to include:

1. Add status column to projects table ✓
2. Create user_profiles table with role field ✓
3. Create activities table for logging ✓

After applying these schema changes, update the TypeScript types and begin implementing the necessary security policies and triggers.
