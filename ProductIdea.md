# Design Brief Tool - GoHighLevel Integration Concept

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architectural approach and user flows for integrating the Design Brief Tool with GoHighLevel's platform. The integration transforms the Design Brief Tool into a white-labeled SaaS product that architecture firms can offer to their clients as the first step in their onboarding process, seamlessly connecting to GoHighLevel's CRM capabilities.

## Integration Vision

The Design Brief Tool will serve as a customized client intake mechanism for architecture firms, collecting comprehensive project information that feeds directly into the GoHighLevel CRM. Each architecture firm (your client) will have a custom-branded version of the Design Brief tool accessible through their GoHighLevel sub-account.

## User Flow Architecture

### Client Journey

1. **Website Entry Point**
   - An "Onboarding" button on the architecture firm's website
   - Click redirects to GoHighLevel authentication page

2. **Authentication Layer**
   - New clients register with name, email, and password
   - Returning clients authenticate via GoHighLevel's native auth system
   - Authentication state persists through the client's journey

3. **Design Brief Form Experience**
   - Upon authentication, clients enter the multi-step Design Brief form process
   - Form data is captured and stored in GoHighLevel's custom fields
   - File uploads are processed and stored within GoHighLevel's storage system

4. **Confirmation & Dashboard View**
   - On submission, clients receive confirmation and access their dashboard
   - Dashboard displays project status, timeline, and communication tools
   - All interactions are tracked in the GoHighLevel CRM

### Architecture Firm Administration Experience

1. **Notification System**
   - Real-time alerts for new submissions via GoHighLevel notifications
   - Workflow triggers for automated responses and process initiation

2. **Brief Review Interface**
   - Admins access a dashboard showing all client submissions
   - Quick filters and search capabilities for managing multiple projects
   - Duplicate detection prevents multiple submissions from the same client

3. **Proposal Management System**
   - Architects create and send proposals through GoHighLevel
   - Clients receive and can accept proposals within the same ecosystem
   - Digital signature capabilities for proposal acceptance

4. **Client Management Hub**
   - Each submission creates/updates a contact in GoHighLevel CRM
   - Full client history and interaction tracking
   - Automated nurture sequences based on project stage

## System Architecture

### Integration Approach

The integration architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns:

```
[Client Browser] ↔ [GoHighLevel Auth] → [Design Brief App] → [GoHighLevel API] → [Sub-account CRM]
```

Key components include:

1. **Authentication Module**
   - Leverages GoHighLevel's OAuth 2.0 authentication system
   - No need to build custom auth - utilize existing GoHighLevel login flow
   - User session management handled by GoHighLevel

2. **Form Data Processing Layer**
   - Maps Design Brief form fields to GoHighLevel custom fields
   - Validates and transforms data before submission
   - Handles conditional logic and field dependencies

3. **File Storage System**
   - Utilizes GoHighLevel's file storage API
   - Manages file uploads, previews, and organization
   - Associates files with specific client records

4. **Notification & Workflow Engine**
   - Connects to GoHighLevel's workflow system
   - Triggers appropriate actions based on form submissions
   - Manages email and SMS communications

5. **Branding & Customization Layer**
   - Implements white-labeling capabilities
   - Allows for custom themes, content, and field configurations
   - Ensures brand consistency across the client experience

### Integration Options

Three approaches are available for integrating the Design Brief Tool with GoHighLevel:

#### 1. Direct API Integration (Recommended)

This approach maintains your existing Design Brief application while connecting it directly to GoHighLevel via API:

- **Authentication**: Redirect to GoHighLevel for auth, receive tokens back
- **Data Flow**: Use GoHighLevel's API to store form submissions as contacts and custom fields
- **File Management**: Upload files directly to GoHighLevel storage via API
- **Benefits**: 
  - Minimal changes to your existing application
  - Leverages GoHighLevel's robust authentication system
  - Simpler maintenance

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Uses OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication and authorization
- Requires mapping your form fields to GoHighLevel custom fields
- May need to modify file upload handling

#### 2. GHL Tools SaaS Integration

An alternative approach using third-party integration platforms specifically built for GoHighLevel:

- **Platform**: Utilize GHL Tools SaaS (or similar integration platforms)
- **Setup**: Configure your Design Brief as a component within GHL Tools
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster implementation
  - Pre-built connection infrastructure
  - May have additional helpful features

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Subscription costs for the integration platform
- Limited customization compared to direct integration
- Dependency on third-party platform updates

#### 3. Embedded iFrame Approach

For quickest implementation with minimal changes:

- **Structure**: Embed your Design Brief tool within GoHighLevel via iFrame
- **Data Exchange**: Use postMessage API for cross-window communication
- **Benefits**:
  - Least modification to existing code
  - Maintains full control over the form experience
  - Quick implementation timeline

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Security considerations for cross-origin communication
- May have some limitations for seamless user experience
- Could face challenges with file uploads across domains
